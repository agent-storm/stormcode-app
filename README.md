# stormcode-app
A simple application made to simplify the learning experience of students, in this app, all the notes, previous year papers, academic syllabus will be available to study and coding in different languages like java, python and c is also possible, this eliminates the  hassle of downloading multiple IDE's for multiple languages.

## Tools used
- Python        - BackEnd
- Python-kivy   - FrontEnd
- Python-kivymd - FrontEnd
- VS code       - IDE
- PyInstaller   - .py -> .exe 
- NSIS          - Installer
- Google Drive  - Publishing platform

## Direct App Installation link 
- https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17GlkWsaUFH3xI6cW-Oyf5cZ6NqnJNklo?usp=sharing
- The installation guide can also be found in the linked folder, the google drive folder belongs to me and therefore there is no need to be concerned with any installation viruses.

## Prerequisite to run the .py
- Kivy         -`pip install kivy`
- Kivy-md      -`pip install kivymd`
- PyInstaller  -`pip install pyisntaller`
  Its recommened that you create a python venv and then install the necessary libraries to keep your main libraries clean.
### Note:
  The above source code does not consist of any compilers or interpreters that are needed to run the application, this is due to github restricting large files, if you want to actually 
edit or use the code, you have to download and place compilers in the Assets>compilers directory (Python, Java, MinGw).
